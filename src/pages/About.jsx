          Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am a frontend developer with a specialization in React and
          a graphic designer hailing from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy turning
          complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I design websites that are both practical and visually appealing, with
          a personal touch. My goal is to showcase your message and identity in
          the most creative way possible.
        </p>
