            Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am a frontend developer with a specialization in React
            and a graphic designer hailing from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy turning
            complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I design websites that are both practical and visually appealing,
            with a personal touch. My goal is to showcase your message and
            identity in the most creative way possible.
          </p>
