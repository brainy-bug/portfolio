          Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am a frontend developer with a specialization in React and
          a graphic designer hailing from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy turning
          complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My job is to build your website so that it is functional and
          user-friendly but at the same time, attractive. Moreover, I add
          personal touch to your product and make sure it is eye-catching and
          easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in
          the most creative way.
        </p>
